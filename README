django-sharer
=============

This is a simple Django application that provides an interface to share a
given item on social networking sites, or send an email to a friend about it.


Dependencies
------------

django-sharer requires Django 1.0 or later. To enable the JavaScript widget,
jQuery 1.2 or later with the jQuery Class plug-in 
<http://github.com/taylanpince/jquery-class> is needed. A combined version of 
these tools is available within the distribution, but if you already are using
jQuery in your project, you might want to grab the Class plug-in separately
and include it in your template.


Installation
------------

To install the app, make sure you place it somewhere on your PYTHONPATH and
include it in your INSTALLED_APPS in settings.py:

    INSTALLED_APPS = (
        ...
        'django-sharer',
        ...
    )

You may also want to include the share_uri context processor in your
TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS:

    TEMPLATE_CONTEXT_PROCESSORS = (
        ...
        'sharer.context_processors.share_uri',
    )

This is not required, but makes it possible for the app to generate a widget
without any parameters.

In your MEDIA_ROOT folder, make a symlink named sharer to the django-sharer's
media directory:

    cd my_project/media
    ln -s path/to/django-sharer/sharer/media sharer

Finally, to use the widget in your templates, load the template tag library,
include the necessary JS and CSS files, and then call the template tag:

    {% load sharer_tags %}
    
    {% block javascript %}
    <script type="text/javascript" src="{{ MEDIA_URL }}sharer/js/sharer.js"></script>
    {% endblock %}

    {% block css %}
    <style type="text/css">
        @import "{{ MEDIA_URL }}sharer/css/sharer.css";
    </style>
    {% endblock %}
    
    {% block content %}
    
    {% share %}
    
    {% endblock %}

You can also call the share template tag with a specific title and/or URL:

    {% share specific_title specific_url %}


Features to be Implemented
